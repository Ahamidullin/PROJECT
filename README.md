## Overview

This project aims to develop a program that utilizes the **NASA Asteroids - NeoWs API** to explore and categorize **Near Earth Objects (NEOs)** based on their characteristics. The program focuses on **fetching information** about NEOs from the NASA Asteroids - NeoWs API and **visualizing this data** for analysis.

## Project Relevance

In today's rapidly evolving world, **space exploration** holds immense significance for humanity's future. **Safeguarding against potential threats** such as asteroid impacts is crucial for our survival.

According to NASA, the probability of a significant **asteroid collision with Earth** occurs roughly once every 10,000 years, emphasizing the importance of **space exploration and vigilance**.

Exploring space and categorizing NEOs provide valuable insights into our universe's composition and help us understand and potentially mitigate the threat of **asteroid impacts**.

By **analyzing data** from the NASA NeoWs API, we can better understand the cosmos and **improve our preparedness** against potential celestial threats.

## Implementation

### Visualization

- Utilize **Qt widgets** to create an intuitive interface for users to interact with the program.

### Data Fetching from NASA NeoWs API

- Develop a **C++ program** using Qt's networking classes to fetch data from the **NASA NeoWs API**.
- Set up **HTTP requests** to retrieve JSON data containing information about NEOs.
- Parse **JSON responses** to extract relevant details like NEO names, distances, diameters, etc.

### Clustering Algorithm Implementation

- Implement a **clustering algorithm**, such as k-means, in C++ to categorize NEO data into clusters based on their attributes.
- Define appropriate **distance metrics** for clustering, considering factors like distance, diameter, and other parameters.
- **Optimize the algorithm** for efficiency and scalability to handle potentially large datasets of NEOs.

### Project Presentation

- Showcase the **functionalities of the Qt interface**, demonstrating how users can interact with and visualize NEO data.
- Explain the **implementation details** of data fetching from the NASA NeoWs API and the clustering algorithm used.
- Discuss any **challenges encountered** during development and the strategies employed to overcome them.
- Present **insights or findings** from the clustered NEO data, discussing potential real-world applications or avenues for further enhancement.

## Requirements

- **C++ compiler**
- **Qt** for developing the application
- **CURL** library for making API requests
- **JSON** library for parsing API response
